Publishing Resources UMCUR Faculty Mentors Research Section Sidebar Navigation Why Do Research? Research allows you to
pursue your interests, to learn something new, to hone your problem-solving skills and to challenge yourself in new
ways. Working on a faculty-initiated research project gives you the opportunity work closely with a mentor a faculty
member or other experienced researcher. With a self-initiated research project, you leave the University of Montana with
a product that represents the distillation of your interests and studies, and possibly, a real contribution to
knowledge. Why should you consider getting involved in research and creative scholarship: Gain hands-on experience
completing a research or creative project. Work closely with a faculty mentor and have the opportunity to connect with
other faculty and other student researchers who work in your area of interest. Earn academic credit, scholarships,
stipends and/or other awards for having conducted research. Hone your leadership and teamwork skills as you collaborate
with others. Gain academic credentials that will help create a well-rounded resume, publishing your work and working
with a research team. Learn valuable life skills for life and class such as professionalism, time management, learning
how to use online research tools. Learn valuable skills for life and class (professionalism, time management,
multi-tasking, online research tools). Learn to effectively communicate your ideas and how to analyze and critique the
work of others. Assisting in research gives you hands-on experience in your field. You gain a deeper understanding of
the scientific process... develop research questions and form and test your hypotheses. You learn what its like to work
in a lab and learn about the planning of experiments, writing grants and how to report findings. You can get paid.
Sometimes as an employee and sometimes as a scholarship You can publish your work. If you help a faculty member they
will mention your work, or you An excellent opportunity to develop relationships with faculty members who work in your
area of interest and make connections with other students working on research. You will build a strong working
relationship with a faculty mentor and be able to ask for a letter of recommendation. An opportunity to hone your
leadership and teamwork skills as you collaborate with others. Opportunity to discover new knowledge and expand about
what you already know. Create a well-rounded resume--you will show "hands-on" experience. You know how to produce
results. You should try to take advantage of every opportunity to make the most of your college experience. Engaging in
projects, whether in a laboratory, a library, a music or art studio, or elsewhere, is a good way of developing your
talents and abilities, finding out the kind of work you are good at, and preparing for graduate study or a career. Such
projects often lead to presentations at professional conferences, which can be a great asset as you apply for graduate
school, scholarships, or even jobs. Every field of study has its own research problems and methods. As a researcher, you
seek answers to questions of great interest to you. Your research problem could be aesthetic, social, political,
scientific or technical. You choose the tools, gather and analyze the data, and report your findings to a wider
audience. What is it like to do research? The research experience varies greatly. You might work alone, or in a large
team. You could conduct your research in a library, a museum, a laboratory, or a community. Secondary Footer Main (406)

Page The Importance of Research in the Advancement of Society Thanks to the internet and other technologies, life moves
at a very fast pace. Were constantly adapting and learning new ways to do things as well as expecting and even
demanding innovation from our scientists, executives, and leaders. Without research, our demands would go completely
unanswered! Curiosity leads to research Research is what propels humanity forward. Its fueled by curiosity: we get
curious, ask questions, and immerse ourselves in discovering everything there is to know. Learning is thriving. Without
curiosity and research, progress would slow to a halt, and our lives as we know them would be completely different. What
would happen without research? If early civilizations hadnt been curious about the dark sky, we wouldnt know anything
about space. Decades of research have led us to where we are today: a civilized society with the knowledge and tools to
move forward. If that research slowed to a standstill, what would happen? Wed become ignorant and unaware. We wouldnt
understand or go forward. Without research, we couldnt say we were close to finding the cure for cancer or find the
most eco-friendly way to light up our homes and offices. We wouldnt know that, even though bees are not our favorites,
they do a job that help us all. Without research, we could not possibly have survived as long as we have. And there are
still millions of things that have yet to be discovered: diseases to cure, waters to explore, species to discover. All
of that is possible with research. The future of research Thankfully, schools are becoming more concerned with science
and technology, and research is finding its place in the minds of todays students. Students are eager to make
discoveries, create solutions to the worlds problems, and invent the next big thing. Were going places, one research
project at a time. How do we enable researchers to spend their time on, well, research (instead of filling out forms)?
Thankfully, theres cloud-based software to make that easier. Researchers and research administrators can find funding
faster, apply for it more easily, manage their funding once they get it, meet federal and local requirements for
documentation, stay in compliance if research involves humans or animals, and make sure research facilities are safe.
All of that means theyre one step closer to tomorrows big discoveries. Adapted from an essay by Cali Simboli Ready for

10 Reasons Why Research is Important by Emmaline Soken-Huberty No matter what career field youre in or how high up you
are, theres always more to learn. The same applies to your personal life. No matter how many experiences you have or
how diverse your social circle, there are things you dont know. Research unlocks the unknowns, lets you explore the
world from different perspectives, and fuels a deeper understanding. In some areas, research is an essential part of
success. In others, it may not be absolutely necessary, but it has many benefits. Here are ten reasons why research is
important: #1. Research expands your knowledge base The most obvious reason to do research is that youll learn more.
Theres always more to learn about a topic, even if you are already well-versed in it. If you arent, research allows
you to build on any personal experience you have with the subject. The process of research opens up new opportunities
for learning and growth. #2. Research gives you the latest information Research encourages you to find the most recent
information available. In certain fields, especially scientific ones, theres always new information and discoveries
being made. Staying updated prevents you from falling behind and giving info thats inaccurate or doesnt paint the
whole picture. With the latest info, youll be better equipped to talk about a subject and build on ideas. #3. Research
helps you know what youre up against In business, youll have competition. Researching your competitors and what
theyre up to helps you formulate your plans and strategies. You can figure out what sets you apart. In other types of
research, like medicine, your research might identify diseases, classify symptoms, and come up with ways to tackle them.
Even if your âenemyâ isnt an actual person or competitor, theres always some kind of antagonist force or problem that
research can help you deal with. #4. Research builds your credibility People will take what you have to say more
seriously when they can tell youre informed. Doing research gives you a solid foundation on which you can build your
ideas and opinions. You can speak with confidence about what you know is accurate. When youve done the research, its
much harder for someone to poke holes in what youre saying. Your research should be focused on the best sources. If
your âresearchâ consists of opinions from non-experts, you wont be very credible. When your research is good, though,
people are more likely to pay attention. #5. Research helps you narrow your scope When youre circling a topic for the
first time, you might not be exactly sure where to start. Most of the time, the amount of work ahead of you is
overwhelming. Whether youre writing a paper or formulating a business plan, its important to narrow the scope at some
point. Research helps you identify the most unique and/or important themes. You can choose the themes that fit best with
the project and its goals. #6. Research teaches you better discernment Doing a lot of research helps you sift through
low-quality and high-quality information. The more research you do on a topic, the better youll get at discerning
whats accurate and whats not. Youll also get better at discerning the gray areas where information may be technically
correct but used to draw questionable conclusions. #7. Research introduces you to new ideas You may already have
opinions and ideas about a topic when you start researching. The more you research, the more viewpoints youll come
across. This encourages you to entertain new ideas and perhaps take a closer look at yours. You might change your mind
about something or, at least, figure out how to position your ideas as the best ones. #8. Research helps with
problem-solving Whether its a personal or professional problem, it helps to look outside yourself for help. Depending
on what the issue is, your research can focus on what others have done before. You might just need more information, so
you can make an informed plan of attack and an informed decision. When you know youve collected good information,
youll feel much more confident in your solution. #9. Research helps you reach people Research is used to help raise
awareness of issues like climate change, racial discrimination, gender inequality, and more. Without hard facts, its
very difficult to prove that climate change is getting worse or that gender inequality isnt progressing as quickly as
it should. The public needs to know what the facts are, so they have a clear idea of what âgetting worseâ or ânot
progressingâ actually means. Research also entails going beyond the raw data and sharing real-life stories that have a
more personal impact on people. #10. Research encourages curiosity Having curiosity and a love of learning take you far
in life. Research opens you up to different opinions and new ideas. It also builds discerning and analytical skills. The
research process rewards curiosity. When youre committed to learning, youre always in a place of growth. Curiosity is
also good for your health. Studies show curiosity is associated with higher levels of positivity, better satisfaction
with life, and lower anxiety. About us TIS provides information about the importance of everything. On our site you can

Guidance 5 reasons why research is important Posted Date: 19 Dec 2020 | Updated: 19-Dec-2020 | Category: Career Guidance
| Author: Umar | Member Level: Gold | Points: 45 | Do you know research is important for evolving analytical concepts
and facilitating better results? Do you know research boosts work and helps gain credibility? Know more more about
research and why it is important for almost every career field. Introduction Research is a robust technique to explore
new concepts through proper observation and facilitates taking the right decision at the right time. research is the
backbone and prerogative to quality work for almost every field. No matter how competent and experienced a person is in
his or her field, without proper research, things go wrong and the success rate declines. Research is vital for almost
everyone irrespective of ones career field-from doctors to lawyers, students to the research scholars of science
stream, from communication to Arts, from professional people to those engaged in small unskilled work, conducting
research is grit to better work. However, it is a myth that research is for science students only and the rest dont
need to research. What is research Research is the pursuit of knowledge through analysis, observation, exploration,
description and explanation of the unexplored idea, facts or methodologies. It enables you to evolve a proper strategy
to carry out a definite work or project without digging too much into unnecessary things and facilitates to take the
right decision when situations demand. Research unfolds many unexplored things that stimulate working capability and
develops the understanding and decision-making of learners. Without research, one has to believe in his or her intuition
or imagination which cant be accurate. That is why research is important for scaling up performance and better results.
Research is important before setting your foot into the work and here are 5 reasons why research is important for
stimulating better results and lending success to the people. Research helps to achieve your goal Many companies have
achieved success by conducting research about their products and services through consumer satisfaction exercises.
Through online surveys, companies offer feedback about their products and services to know customer satisfaction and it
provides them with an opportunity to tailor their businesses and improve their services. A research scholar cant
complete his research degree without conducting proper and extensive research on his or her subject. He goes on to carry
out research work by observation and exploration that helps the scholars get closer to their target and submit a thesis
for consideration to the supervisor. Research reveals new ideas and facts Research sparks new ideas and facts; enables
the researcher to draw novel conclusions about his research topic. The more deeply one researches a particular subject
better he may get into the field and properly help position his or her ideas. Research stimulates different ideas and
helps build discerning and analytical concepts. When a learner is curious to know, research provides him with a gateway
to explore and explain different dimensions of the subject. Research provides a great learning curve and infuses
positivity in the researcher and learners through the exploration of new ideas and facts. It also helps raise awareness
about the subject matter and provides new facts to the people. Research develops understanding and decision-making It is
the most valuable tool to understand the complexities of a problem, disapprove of lies, uphold truth and build on to
create knowledge that is reliable and authentic. Conducting research develops a better understanding and enhances
decision-making capabilities. Researchers analyze the details of a project and help take the right and well-informed
decisions. Understanding the problem and for decision making, it is important to know facts observed and explored
through research for better results and not rely on imagination or intuition to fade the quality of the work. Research
prompts decision-making and develops a better understanding to solve the problems. Research helps understand whats not
working Research provides you with an opportunity to detect and investigate many new things that are not working for
your project. Research helps you find a new concept or some amazing information about any particular topic, it also
unfolds many antagonist elements not suitable for your project. Research not only helps explore what is beneficial and
working for your project, but it also explains different aspects that are invalid and not working for your venture.
Research builds credibility Any argument or statement based on imagination or intuition affects the reputation and
credibility of the subject and researcher. Research on the subjects scales up credibility and weight to it and critics
wouldnt find holes and would appreciate the research project. It also helps boost the confidence of the researcher.
Research builds a solid foundation when novel ideas are studied, experimented and explained to the learners and
organizations for accelerating the success rate to gain credibility for the research project. Conclusion Research is a
broad concept required in almost every field to improve performance and quality of work. Research is important to build
a better understanding, decision making and, discerning and analytical ideas to facilitate better results. Without
extensive research projects can get derailed and minimize the success rate. The work without proper research would be
filled with faults and failures that affect the reputation of a company and researcher. People build a negative opinion
about the work and therefore, become a setback for the organization. Research generates novel ideas, builds credibility,
and develops understanding and analytical skills so a researcher could implement his or her guts to rationalize the work
and build a better foundation for followers in the career field and so they could take the right decision at the right
time without facing hurdles. CommentsAuthor: Swati Sharma 29 Dec 2020 Member Level: Gold Points : 2 An explanatory
article is written by the author. The word research originated from a word that means "to go in all directions" or to
search. Research is the systematic scientific method in which the knowledge base is increased by the use of scientific
tools to scour existing knowledge, develop it, or discover any new fact. Research provides new knowledge. This not only
resolves curiosities, but it is possible to move forward on the path of progress. Notify me by email when others post

Veronica . Veronica . Marketing Assistant at VKONTE Published Apr 30, 2021 + Follow Research, revolution, and
development are the driving force for the economic and social development of every country. The common interest of all
countries in scientific research is embodied in their understanding of their role in confirming the well-being of human
civilization. The level of social development depends mainly on the implementation of its education and research
systems, the education level of its residents, the excellence of research products, and the equal right to use the
services and products of these systems by all potential users. How does research impact our daily life? In short, have
you ever wondered what the world would be like without technological development? Now, everything that people enjoy now
and what they can do in a few minutes (previously thought to be impossible) is attributed to research. The Research is
not restricted to one department but is conducted in almost all departments. Some of these measures include technical,
health, national defense, and natural disaster prevention measures. Therefore, research plays a very vital role in our
daily lives. Research is the most significant and most dependable way to understand and solve the complexity of numerous
problems faced by humanity. Researcher teaches people Researchers have increased awareness of issues such as climate
change, gender inequality, and racism. Without reliable data, it is difficult to confirm that climate change is
intensifying and that gender inequality is not developing as fast as expected. The public needs to know the facts. In
this way, you can clearly understand the meaning of "getting worse" or "not improving." The research also includes
sharing real-life stories, which are not limited to raw data but have a more significant impact on people. What would
happen without research? If early nations were not interested in the dark sky, then we knew nothing about the universe.
After decades of research, we have reached our current location, a civil society with the knowledge and tools to
advance. What if you stop the research without a researcher? We are uninformed and ignorant. We do not understand or do
not move forward. Without researchers, we cannot find a cure for cancer, nor can we find the most environmentally
friendly way to illuminate our houses and offices. Even if bees are not our favorite, we dont know that bees are
helping us all. Without researchers, we would not survive. Millions of things have yet to discover: diseases to be
treated, water to be discovered, species to be discovered. All of this is possible through research. The future of
research Fortunately, schools are becoming more anxious about science and technology, and research has found its place
in the minds of todays students. Students are keen to discover, develop solutions to world problems, and discover the
next big thing. We are working on one research project at a time. Conclusion The key objective of researchers is to
inform behavior, collect theoretical evidence, contribute to the development of knowledge in the research field, and
ultimately help society. Researchers perform an essential role in learning new treatments and ensuring that existing
treatments are used best. They can find answers to the unknown, bridge knowledge gaps, and change the way healthcare
professionals work. Like Comment Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Share 17 To view or add a comment, sign in More articles

Privacy Technology Sunday, 30 May 2021 20:38 Six Reasons Why Research is Important By Erin R. Goodrich Everyone conducts
research in some form or another from a young age, whether news, books, or browsing the Internet. Internet users come
across thoughts, ideas, or perspectives - the curiosity that drives the desire to explore. However, when research is
essential to make practical decisions, the nature of the study alters - it all depends on its application and purpose.
For instance, skilled research offered as a research paper service has a definite objective, and it is focused and
organized. Professional research helps derive inferences and conclusions from solving problems. visit the HB tool
services for the amazing research tools that will help to solve your problems regarding the research on any project.
What is the Importance of Research? The primary goal of the research is to guide action, gather evidence for theories,
and contribute to the growth of knowledge in data analysis. This article discusses the importance of research and the
multiple reasons why it is beneficial to everyone, not just students and scientists. Research skills are an important
component of the writing process because they allow authors to discover information and build an outline for their
writing project, whether creative or academic. By building systematic and effective research techniques, you will become
knowledgeable about any topic that you need to write about. On the other hand, research is important in business
decision-making because it can assist in making better decisions when combined with their experience and intuition.
Reasons for the Importance of Research Acquire Knowledge Effectively Research helps in problem-solving Provides the
latest information Builds credibility Helps in business success Discover and Seize opportunities 1- Acquire Knowledge
Efficiently through Research The most apparent reason to conduct research is to understand more. Even if you think you
know everything there is to know about a subject, there is always more to learn. Research helps you expand on any prior
knowledge you have of the subject. The research process creates new opportunities for learning and progress. 2- Research
Helps in Problem-solving The goal of the research is to broaden our understanding. Research gives us the information and
knowledge to solve problems and make decisions. To differentiate between research that attempts to advance our knowledge
and research that seeks to apply pre-existing information to real-world situations. The goal of research in this setting
is problem-solving. Problem-solving can be divided into several components, which require knowledge and analysis, for
example, identification of issues, cause identification, identifying potential solutions, decision to take action,
monitoring and evaluation of activity and outcomes. You may just require additional knowledge to formulate an informed
strategy and make an informed decision. When you know youve gathered reliable data, youll be a lot more confident in
your answer. 3- Research Provides the Latest Information Research enables you to seek out the most up-to-date facts.
There is always new knowledge and discoveries in various sectors, particularly scientific ones. Staying updated keeps
you from falling behind and providing inaccurate or incomplete information. Youll be better prepared to discuss a topic
and build on ideas if you have the most up-to-date information. With the help of tools and certifications such as CIRS,
you may learn internet research skills quickly and easily. Internet research can provide instant, global access to
information. 4- Research Builds Credibility Research provides a solid basis for formulating thoughts and views. You can
speak confidently about something you know to be true. Its much more difficult for someone to find flaws in your
arguments after youve finished your tasks. In your study, you should prioritize the most reputable sources. Your
research should focus on the most reliable sources. You wont be credible if your "research" comprises non-experts
opinions. People are more inclined to pay attention if your research is excellent. 5- Research Helps in Business Success
Like any other technical work, a business demands a lot of energy. A successful business cannot be done without solid
proof and market research. That being said, it makes research the foremost step before doing any business. Businesses
fail at a rate of close to 90% if proper research is not conducted. So, it is always better to do appropriate research
in every way before jumping into any business. Businesses prosper because they have sensible owners who researched their
product and the market research before launching it. Only if we pay attention to these nit-picks of a company and see
the importance of research decision-making will there be a higher chance to find, gauge, and seize opportunities. R&D
might also help you gain a competitive advantage. Finding ways to make things run more smoothly and differentiate a
companys products from those of its competitors can help to increase a companys market worth. 6- Research Discover and
Seize Opportunities People can maximize their potential and achieve their goals through various opportunities provided
by research. These include getting jobs, scholarships, educational subsidies, projects, commercial collaboration, and
budgeted travel. Research is essential for anyone looking for work or a change of environment. Unemployed people will
have a better chance of finding potential employers through job advertisements or agencies. How to Improve Your Research
Skills Start with the big picture and work your way down It might be hard to figure out where to start when you start
researching. Theres nothing wrong with a simple internet search to get you started. Online resources like Google and
Wikipedia are a great way to get a general idea of a subject, even though they arent always correct. They usually give
a basic overview with a short history and any important points. Identify Reliable Source Not every source is reliable,
so its critical that you can tell the difference between the good ones and the bad ones. To find a reliable source, use
your analytical and critical thinking skills and ask yourself the following questions: Is this source consistent with
other sources Ive discovered? Is the author a subject matter expert? Is there a conflict of interest in the authors
point of view on this topic? Validate Information from Various Sources The internet is a vast zone where everyone can
say whatever they want. Identify the source of information and determine whether it is reliable and credible. Check
whether there are at least two additional sources you can receive the same information. Take in new Information The
purpose of research is to find answers to your questions, not back up what you already assume. Only looking for
confirmation is a minimal way to research because it forces you to pick and choose what information you get and stops
you from getting the most accurate picture of the subject. When you do research, keep an open mind to learn as much as
possible. Facilitates Learning Process Learning new things and implementing them in daily life can be frustrating.
Finding relevant and credible information requires specialized training and web search skills due to the sheer enormity
of the Internet and the rapid growth of indexed web pages. On the other hand, short courses and Certifications like CIRS
make the research process more accessible. CIRS Certification offers complete knowledge from beginner to expert level.
You can become a Certified Professional Researcher and get a high-paying job, but youll also be much more efficient and
skilled at filtering out reliable data. You can learn more about becoming a Certified Professional Researcher. Stay
Organized Youll see a lot of different material during the process of gathering data, from web pages to PDFs to videos.
You must keep all of this information organized in some way so that you dont lose anything or forget to mention
something properly. There are many ways to keep your research project organized, but here are a few of the most common:
Learning Management Software, Bookmarks in your browser, index cards, and a bibliography that you can add to as you go
are all excellent tools for writing. Make Use of the librarys Resources If you still have questions about researching,
dont worryâeven if youre not a student performing academic or course-related research, there are many resources
available to assist you. Many high school and university libraries, in reality, provide resources not only for staff and
students but also for the general public. Look for research guidelines or access to specific databases on the librarys
website. Association of Internet Research Specialists enjoys sharing informational content such as research-related
articles, research papers, specialized search engines list compiled from various sources, and contributions from our
members and in-house experts. Conclusion Research methods have evolved a lot, but research value has only increased. We
observe that internet research is gaining traction, and the importance of research is growing by the day. As a result,
businesses are searching for full-time online researchers to collaborate with them and conduct research for reliable
data from online sources. In addition, research has become a necessity for survival. We cant make professional
